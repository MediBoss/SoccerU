# Proposal for the SoccerU REST Api


## What?

SoccerU is an authenticated REST Api that servers real data for soccer leagues, teams, and players.

## Why?

* I am creating SoccerU because...
* Many top sports companies like ESPN do not publicly expose their data for the developer communities.
* SoccerU can be used to for beginers ios developers who want to learn more about authentictsed networking.
* SoccerU can be consumed by developers who are building soccer-related websites.


## Models

* Users
* Leagues
* Teams

* Comments

## Model Relationships
