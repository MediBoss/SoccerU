# Proposal for the SoccerU REST Api


## What?
SoccerU is an authenticated REST Api that servers real data for soccer leagues, teams, and players. 

## Why?
I am creating SoccerU because many top sports companies like ESPN do not publicly expose their data for the developer communities. SoccerU can be used to for beginers ios developers who want to learn more about authentictsed networking or backend developers who are interested in soccer.
